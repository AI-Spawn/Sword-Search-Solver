# Sword-Search-Solver
CS50x Puzzle Day 2020 featured a puzzle called Sword Search, a word search with swords. However, the names of swords had random letters put in. This program takes an inputed word list, and outputs a word list that has every combination of noise letters added. Then, this word list is run through a version of James231/Wordsearch-Solver-Python which I modified to run batch.
